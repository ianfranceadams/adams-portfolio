      I most recently worked as the UX/UI Designer at an exciting mobility startup called <a href="https://www.veoride.com" target="new" cursor="pointer" style="font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -.4px;"><span
      >VeoRide</span></a> helping to revamp their mobile app and make the dockless micromobility experience more fun and beneficial for both riders and their communities. While the details of this work are protected by an NDA, I am happy to share broadly about what I worked on at VeoRide. These are the key things I learned from my time there (more detailed account of projects further down):
<br> 
         
   
     </p>
     
     <ul class="l1">
         <li>
           Working closely and communicating effectively with a culturally diverse dev team is rewarding and refines my design process, ensuring clear understanding and precise, quality implementation.
         </li>
     </ul> 
     <ul class="l2">
         <li>
           Working with hardware adds interest to a technology product, but can also hamper iterative improvement given  stubborn technical challenges that are slow or nearly impossible to resolve. 
         </li>
     </ul> 
     <ul class="l3">
         <li>Testing and field research are always essential, but especially with hardware. Constant contact with field operations personnel helps with acquiring this priceless first-hand user feedback.
         </li>
     </ul> 
     <ul class="l4">
        <li>
           An early-stage startup is exciting to work for, but inchoate branding, culture, and leadership can be challenging to function and progress within, even for a self-motivated professional.
        </li>
     </ul>

         <p> I produced all screen samples in Sketch. VeoRide's graphic designer produced all icons and illustrations. The third screen features a screenshot from an instructional animation made by a freelancer. </p>

     <li>  <a href="https://lottiefiles.com/share/r2TL6O" target="new" style="border-bottom: 2px #00B8AA solid; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -.4px;">Click here</a> to see an example of one of these animations (reminding to not block pedestrians). And one more example <a href="https://lottiefiles.com/share/mLaWny" target="new" style="border-bottom: 2px #00B8AA solid; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -.4px;">here</a> (showing how to lock a bike) </li>
</ul>
    
<br>

   <li>Constant monitoring of social media mentions and app reviews to gauge sentiment and improve service </li>
   <li>Regular contact with local market managers to learn of opportunities for app and overall service improvement </li>

    <li>Consistently translated user research into concrete app improvements that improved functionality and understandability for users and addressed needs of other stakeholders like city governments </li>
    
    
</ul>
    <br>
   <ul>And finally, <a href="https://www.veoride.com/cold-weather-biking-is-fun/" target="new" style="border-bottom: 2px #00B8AA solid; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -.4px;">here</a> is a quick blog post I wrote last year to promote safe and fun winter biking! (Illustration and web development by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/birdteethcreate/" target="new" style="border-bottom: 1px black solid;">Remy Thomas</a>).  </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    
    While I've enjoyed the experience and learned so much working at this vibrant, early-stage startup, I'm currently looking forward to a new opportunity for growth at a more established organization. I look forward to joining a full-scale product or UX team and collaborating with other designers.
