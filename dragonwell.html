     <h3 class="chal"> The Challenge </h3>
     
     <p class="chalp"> The goal was to create an online tea and coffee shop that would be as pleasing to use as possible.&nbsp; So much of ecommerce is fraught with complexity and confusion, inevitably leading to missed opportunities for all involved.&nbsp; It’s time to see the careful, deliberate process of user-centered design applied to this special niche of online shopping.&nbsp; Above all, the experience of searching, browsing, and making a purchase should be effortless.&nbsp; Additionally, a successful online tea and coffee shop must provide ample, detailed product information in a way that is easily digested and stimulating to the senses. </p>

       <h3 class="sol"> <span>The Solution</span> </h3>
     
     <p class="solp"> Through the process of discovery and subsequent iteration, an attractive online store emerged that would help anyone, from the most choosy tea drinker to a casual coffee browser, navigate and buy exactly what they want without headaches.&nbsp; Search bars are consistently prominent throughout the site, and in each category section, narrowing down one’s options is a straightforward on or off button for any mixture of parameters, such as dark roast coffees from Asia or all flavored green teas.&nbsp; The most particular users can always  quickly and easily keyword search for the exact variety they want and the checkout process is a very clear, linear, and relaxed step-by-step process.  </p>

     <h3 class="pro"> The Process </h3>
     
     <p class="prop"> The process began with a <span>survey</span> from which I gleaned the main desires of potential online tea and coffee shoppers.&nbsp; Their main concerns were regarding ease of navigation, search, and browsing, plus a painless checkout.&nbsp; Also important was a desire for more clarity and accuracy with product information through large photos and ample specifications. 
         
     <br>  <br> <span>Competitive analysis</span> gauged the caliber of service, usability, and aesthetics of other worthy competitors in the tea and coffee space.&nbsp; Peet’s Coffee, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, and McNulty’s Tea & Coffee were formidable examples to learn from.
    </p>
     
    
    
    
    
     <div class="peets">
       <img src="images/peets.jpg">
         <p> A prestigious brand known for rich flavors.&nbsp; The website color scheme definitely reflects this, but could use some aesthetic updating and greater checkout ease. </p>
    </div>
    
    
    
    
  
     <div class="cbtl">
       <img src="images/coffeebeanlogo.png">
         <p> This tea and coffee source is very popular in southern California.&nbsp; Their website has crisp, modern branding, but is rather light on tea choices and visually dry overall. </p>
    </div>
    
     <div class="mcnt">
       <img src="images/mcnultys.png">
         <p> I admire McNulty's sense of history and warm neighborhood ethos.&nbsp;  It would benefit from a more refined and readable use of fonts and colors. </p>
    </div>
     
    
    
    
     <p class="comp">  Armed with these initial, orienting insights, I moved on to creating <span>personas</span> that showcased three users needing ease of precise search, ease of ordering and re-ordering, and ease of browsing with straightforward ordering and shipping. </p>

    </div>
    
    
    
     
     <p class="flowp"> Cataloging all potential tea and coffee shopping tasks into <span>user stories</span> and then constructing <span>user flows</span> from them fleshed out each and every step involved in browsing and making a purchase or requesting a change or refund.&nbsp; These would enable the creation of wireframes that address every user need in a given flow. </p>

     <h3 class="bran"> Branding & Visual Design </h3>
     
    <p class="branp"> At this stage, with relatable hypothetical users and their stories more fully in view,  I began on branding.&nbsp; I created a color palette initially inspired by the earthy but radiant green color of bancha green tea leaves.&nbsp; Rather than pair this with the obvious dark brown of coffee, I chose a more complementary deep red that isn’t far from brown but that conveys more of a richness, energy, and refinement that would speak to drinkers seeking both invigoration and subtlety from their tea and coffee.<br> <br>

    I named the shop after a famous variety of green tea from China called Dragonwell, sure to spark the imagination of tea connoisseurs as well as anyone seeking a warm and flavorful energy boost.&nbsp; The chosen fonts further emphasized refinement with EB Garamond conveying handmade beauty and centuries-old tradition, and Gill Sans serving as a clean, similarly shaped, sans-serif contrast better for buttons, labels, and menu items needing cleaner readability.  </p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="tsk2">
       <img src="images/teasketch2.png">
    </div> 
    
    
    <p class="branp2"> Above is some sketching I did to create a logo.  I decided to focus on the timeless, elegant Garamond text itself but wanted to add an ornament based on the long, twisting, verdant beauty of premium green tea leaves themselves.&nbsp; In other instance, sketching helped digest feebback from early stage wireframe user testing. </p>
