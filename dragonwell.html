     <h3 class="chal"> The Challenge </h3>
     
     <p class="chalp"> The goal was to create an online tea and coffee shop that would be as pleasing to use as possible.&nbsp; So much of ecommerce is fraught with complexity and confusion, inevitably leading to missed opportunities for all involved.&nbsp; It’s time to see the careful, deliberate process of user-centered design applied to this special niche of online shopping.&nbsp; Above all, the experience of searching, browsing, and making a purchase should be effortless.&nbsp; Additionally, a successful online tea and coffee shop must provide ample, detailed product information in a way that is easily digested and stimulating to the senses. </p>

       <h3 class="sol"> The Solution </h3>
     
     <p class="solp"> Through the process of discovery and subsequent iteration, an attractive online store emerged that would help anyone, from the most choosy tea drinker to a casual coffee browser, navigate and buy exactly what they want without headaches.&nbsp; Search bars are consistently prominent throughout the site, and in each category section, narrowing down one’s options is a straightforward on or off button for any mixture of parameters, such as dark roast coffees from Asia or all flavored green teas.&nbsp; The most particular users can always  quickly and easily keyword search for the exact variety they want and the checkout process is a very clear, linear, and relaxed step-by-step process.  </p>
