      <p class="position">Ever since I was small, two things greatly fascinated me: how things work and how things look. As I’ve gotten older, the workings of the human psyche become ever more intriguing, too. Having had a wide range of work experience and encounters with technology, from enjoyable to dreary, I've found user experience design matches brilliantly with this background. My education in music and the liberal arts also instills reverence for how deep thinking, polished aesthetics, and exacting craftsmanship impact audiences for the better.

      >VeoRide</span></a> helping to revamp their mobile app and make the dockless micromobility experience more fun and beneficial for both riders and their communities. While the details of this work is protected by an NDA, I am happy to share broadly about these projects I worked on at VeoRide:
