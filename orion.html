     <h3 class="chal"> The Challenge </h3>
     
     <p class="chalp"> Using a brief survey sent to my network and strategically posted on forums like Reddit and Slack, noticeable patterns emerged from the responses to questions regarding existing note taking, image saving, and link bookmarking methods.&nbsp; While some respondents expressed satisfaction with the basic utility of current methods, many also complained about the tendency to lose notes and inability to better organize or edit bookmarked links or saved images.  </p>

       <h3 class="sol"> The Solution </h3>
     
     <p class="solp">  The solution was a fairly clean and open dashboard design on which users could easily lay out their various content items.&nbsp; A left-side drawer menu would enable easy toggling between either all of their items, just notes, just images, or just links.&nbsp; An easily visible add button with a dropdown menu would make adding new content quick and simple.&nbsp; This menu also has a “Boxes” section where users can create categories for more thorough organization of their various items.  </p>

     <h3 class="pro"> The Process </h3>
     
     <p class="prop">  The process began with a <span>survey</span> that thankfully had responses from a diverse range of users geographically and in different professions.&nbsp; Simplicity and clear organization were what users wanted beyond the quick practicality of existing, disparate tools.  
     <br>  <br> 
         
     This naturally led to <span>competitive analysis</span> of existing note, image, and link storage and organization platforms.&nbsp; Google Drive naturally stood out, along with similar platforms like Dropbox and Evernote.&nbsp; In hindsight, I probably should have analyzed these a good deal more, but I wanted to also give existing, perhaps more primitive tools (like the basic Notes app as well as pen and paper) their due, given how quick, convenient, and therefore popular (based on survey results) they still are.&nbsp; Clearly their ease should be incorporated into an effective app that nonetheless can do a lot more for users.  
    </p>
     
    
    
    
    
     <div class="peets">
       <img src="images/Ogoogledrive.png">
         <p> Google Drive is a major player in this space although users often complain about its complexity and how difficult it can be to find a desired item.&nbsp; This space needs a stress-free and aesthetically pleasing alternative.  </p>
    </div>

  
     <div class="cbtl">
       <img src="images/Onotes.png">
         <p> The trusty, workaday Notes app on many smartphones seems to meet many users' basic need for taking down a quick note, but ultimate it has little to offer in the way of organization or aesthetic appeal. </p>
    </div>
    
     <div class="mcnt">
       <img src="images/Opadpaper.png">
         <p> It's worth noting the value of this formidable player from the analog world.&nbsp; Haphazard as it is, wouldn't it be great if an app like Orion could nonetheless mimic its satisfying, tactile spontaneity?  </p>
    </div>
     

    
    
     <p class="comp">  <span>Personas</span> came next, based on initial research findings.&nbsp; I have a special affection for this somewhat imaginative step of the design process.&nbsp; Through it, the somewhat dry and diffuse data from survey responses can coalesce into more real characters to take seriously as potential human users. </p>

    <p class="branp"> With a basic understanding of user needs and the broader structure of Orion coming into view, I took time to do work on its more aesthetic aspects.&nbsp; I arrived at the name Orion when thinking of what a beloved constellation it is and, especially, how easy it is to find for most stargazers.&nbsp; Below is some logo brainstorming sketching I did based the famous three stars of Orion.&nbsp; Finding one's content in Orion should be as easy as finding those three stars.

    </div>
    
    <h3 class="conc"> Conclusion </h3>
     
    <p class="concp"> Working through the design process of Orion was challenging and enlightening.&nbsp; The use of surveys and tests freed me from idle speculation and instead grounded me in responses from real users to my work.&nbsp; The answer to every question was ultimately to test, and I wish I had subjected every element of the design to a lot more testing via navigation testing and preference testing with alternative ideas.<br> <br>  The final product is therefore only the outermost realization of weeks of iterative effort (although, again, a bit more abbreviated than would be desirable).&nbsp;
    Each element is as purposefully chosen as possible to provide users with an all-in-one organization system that will make their daily life easier.&nbsp; In the future, I look forward to a much more extensive research and testing process.
