# This is the repository for my portfolio website:
# www.ianadamsdesign.com
# It features links to an About page, a Resume page (with link to PDF file), and a contact form page in the main header navigation throughout.  The main purpose of the site, however, is to show case studies from three projects I completed over the last year:
# Dragonwell Tea & Coffee
An online tea and coffee shop design project that honed my knowledge of effective ecommerce and visual design.

# ShowBuddy
A mobile app design for concert and live performance finding.  Quick onboarding and ease of browsing and navigation were its main priorities.

# Orion
This project introduced me to the fundamentals of the entire design process from user research to designing and developing a coded partial prototype.  The product itself is a content storage system that emphasizes ease and clarity of organization.
